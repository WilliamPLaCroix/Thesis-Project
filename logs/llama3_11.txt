To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

* Simplified the vocabulary: "electrification" is a complex term, and I replaced it with "were electrified", which is a more straightforward way to express the same idea.
* Added a transition word: "Later" helps to connect the two ideas and make the sentence flow better.
* Defined the term "single-deck trams": I added a brief explanation to help students understand what a single-deck tram is, in case they're not familiar with the term.

Pred: Here's a rewritten version of the text that's easier for Grade 11 students to understand:

"The reason Neptune looks blue is similar to why Uranus looks blue. This is because methane in Neptune's atmosphere absorbs red light, which makes the planet appear blue. However, Neptune's blue color is much more intense than Uranus's. Scientists think that there's something else in Neptune's atmosphere that's contributing to its bright blue color, because the amount of methane in Neptune's atmosphere is similar to Uranus's."

I made the following changes to make the text more accessible to Grade 11 students:

* Simplified the vocabulary (e.g. "vivid azure" became "bright blue")
* Shortened the sentence structure and used more concise language
* Added transitional phrases to connect the ideas between sentences
* Emphasized the main points and ideas to make the text more clear and easy to follow.

Pred: Here's a rewritten version of the text that's easier for Grade 11 students to understand:

"A sit-in and a sit-down strike are similar, but they involve different groups of people. A sit-in is when a group of protesters, usually students or activists, occupy a place where they want to make a point, like a school or a store. They stay there until their demands are met.

A sit-down strike, on the other hand, is when workers who are on strike occupy the workplace where they normally work. They refuse to leave until their demands are met, so that their jobs can't be taken over by someone else who might not agree with their demands. This is often done to show that the workers are willing to take a stand and fight for what they believe in."

I made the following changes to make the text more accessible to Grade 11 students:

* Simplified the vocabulary and sentence structure
* Added transitional phrases to help students follow the comparison between sit-ins and sit-down strikes
* Provided more context and examples to help students understand the concepts
* Emphasized the key differences between the two types of protests

* Added more context: I provided a brief explanation of what kind of environments these bacteria can live in, to help students visualize and understand the concept better.
* Made the sentence more concise: I condensed the original sentence into a shorter, more straightforward statement that still conveys the main idea.
Label: The family Hydrogenothemaceae are bacteria that live in harsh environmental settings.

[rank0]:[W411 16:36:37.462634024 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:1250] Warning: WARNING: process group has NOT been destroyed before we destruct ProcessGroupNCCL. On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())
