If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

"When we look at rocks, we can see how they change over time. Sometimes, the rocks get layered on top of each other in a specific order, like a big sandwich. This is called bedding. Other times, the rocks change as you move from one place to another, like from a beach to a river. This is called a facies change. It's like a big puzzle, and by studying the rocks, we can figure out what the environment was like when they were formed."

Or, if you want to make it even more accessible:

"Imagine you're on a hike and you see different types of rocks. As you walk, the rocks might change from sandstone to shale to limestone. This is because the rocks were formed in different places, like a beach, a river, and a lake. By studying these changes, we can learn about the history of the area and what the environment was like a long time ago."

"When we calculate how well our predictions match the actual data, we get a list of numbers called residuals. If we add up all these residuals, we always get zero. This means that the residuals can't be independent of each other, because if one residual is positive, the others have to be negative to make the total zero."

Or, in an even simpler way:

"When we compare our predictions to the actual data, we get a list of numbers that show how well we did. If we add up all these numbers, they always add up to zero. This means that the numbers can't be independent of each other, because if one number is too big, the others have to be smaller to balance it out."

"Simon Peyton Jones is a very smart computer scientist. He was born in South Africa on January 18, 1958. He studies how to make computers work better with special kinds of programming languages that are called 'functional languages'. He's especially interested in languages that don't do a lot of work until they really need to, which is called 'lazy'."

I made the following changes to make the text more accessible to Grade 7 students:

* Simplified the vocabulary (e.g. "researches" became "studies")
* Shortened the sentence structure
* Removed technical terms like "implementation" and "applications"
* Added a brief explanation of what functional programming languages are
* Made the language more conversational and easy to understand
Label: Simon Peyton Jones (1958 -) born in South Africa and is a British computer scientist. He does research on (lazy) functional programming languages, such as Haskell.

Pred: Here's a rewritten version of the sentence that's easier for Grade 7 students to understand:

"A long time ago, in countries like Britain, Ireland, and France, the people called the areas that are now called counties by a different name, called earldoms. This name comes from a language called Old Norse, and it was given to these areas by the Vikings. But, even though the names are different, the areas that are now called counties and the areas that were called earldoms are not the same thing."
Label: So the Republic of Ireland now has thirty-four "county-level" units.

Pred: Here's a rewritten version of the input sentence that's easier for Grade 7 students to understand:

"In the United States, there are over 5,500 cities and towns. Minas has 853 of them, which is a lot because the city is very big and has a lot of people living there."

Or, if you want to make it even more accessible:

"There are over 5,500 cities and towns in the country. Minas is one of them, and it's special because it's very large and has a lot of people living there."

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Changed "municipalities" to "cities and towns" to make it more relatable to Grade 7 students.
* Removed the phrase "the number of inhabitants" and replaced it with "a lot of people living there" to make it more concrete and easy to understand.
* Changed "vast territory" to "very big" to make it more accessible to younger readers.
* Used simpler vocabulary and sentence structures to make the text easier to follow.

If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use LlamaForCausalLM for predictions without further training.

[rank0]:[W411 16:35:14.141431586 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:1250] Warning: WARNING: process group has NOT been destroyed before we destruct ProcessGroupNCCL. On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())
