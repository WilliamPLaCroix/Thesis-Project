To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

Pred: Here's a rewritten version of the sentence that's easy for Grade 3 students to understand:

"The part of our body that helps us relax and feel calm is called the 'rest and digest' part of our nervous system."

Or, if you'd like a more literal translation:

"The 'rest and digest' part of our body's 'nerve system' is called the 'parasympathetic' part."

Here's a breakdown of the sentence:

* "Pars" means "part" or "section"
* "Parasympathica" is the name of the part, which means "rest and digest"
* "Divisionis" means "of the" or "belonging to"
* "Autonomici" means "self-controlled" or "automatic"
* "Systematis" means "of the system"
* "Nervosi" means "nervous system"
* "Nervosi" is the Latin word for "nervous system", but in this context, it's used to describe the part of the system that's being referred to.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

* Shortened the sentence structure
* Added more concrete and relatable language (e.g. "buy things" instead of "used to buy things")
* Included a time frame that's easy for students to understand (e.g. "a long, long time ago")

Pred: Here's a rewritten version of the sentence that's easier for Grade 3 students to understand:

"Some people think that the book was written by more than one person. There are clues in the book that show that two names, 'Agur' and 'Lemuel', might be connected to different parts of the book. It's also possible that the book was written by different people at different times."

I made the following changes to make the sentence more accessible to Grade 3 students:

* Simplified the language and sentence structure
* Avoided using complex vocabulary like "disunity" and "elements"
* Used more concrete and relatable examples, like "clues" and "different parts of the book"
* Made the sentence more concrete and easy to understand by using phrases like "some people think" and "it's possible"
Label: In their eyes the words "Agur" and "Lamuel" were only other names for Solomon.

Pred: Here's a rewritten version of the sentence that's easy for Grade 3 students to understand:

"A big storm called a hurricane hit the islands of Hawaii. The wind was very strong, blowing up to 100 miles per hour! The ocean was also very rough, with waves as high as 30 feet in the air."

I made the following changes to make the sentence more accessible to Grade 3 students:

* Simplified the vocabulary (e.g. "devastated" became "hit", "gusts" became "blowing")
* Used more concrete and relatable examples (e.g. "big storm" instead of "hurricane", "waves as high as 30 feet in the air" instead of "rough seas exceeding 30 feet in height")
* Avoided using technical terms like "mph" and "km/h"
Label: The storm caused very bad damage on the islands of Niihau, Kauai, and Oahu. Some wind gusts reached 100 mph (160 km\/h), and waves were over 30 feet (9 m) high.

If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use LlamaForCausalLM for predictions without further training.

[rank0]:[W411 16:33:56.916945801 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:1250] Warning: WARNING: process group has NOT been destroyed before we destruct ProcessGroupNCCL. On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())
